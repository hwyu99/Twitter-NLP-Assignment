60% of our planet is covered by water over 1,600m deep, and nearly half the world's marine waters are over 3,000m deep.
The deep sea starts where the sunlight starts to fade, around 200m below the surface of the ocean. A twilight zone extends down to 1,000m, after which almost no light penetrates. The water is cold, reaching 3oC, and contains very little oxygen. And the weight of the water above creates enormous pressures, up to 1,000 times that at the surface.
With no sunlight, plants cannot grow in the deep sea. And while animals and bacteria have been found wherever people have looked, we know very little about these dark, cold depths. More people have travelled into space than have ventured into the deep.

We do know that deep-sea habitats are as varied as those on land: vast plains, volcanoes, the longest mountain chain on Earth, deep canyons, sulphurous geysers, and of course, a huge volume of open water.

Incredible biological discoveries have been made in the last 30 years. These include entire new ecosystems such as cold-water coral reefs and vibrant communities based around chemicals pouring from the Earth's crust, as well as a whole host of alien-looking fish and other animals. Scientists now think there may be more species in the deep sea than in all the other environments on Earth combined - by some estimates, as many as 100 million species may live there.

The deep sea is beyond most people's direct experience - but you may be more familiar with some of its creatures than you think. Fishers are increasingly targeting deep-water fisheries around the world.

Ocean ecology: the dim and dark depths

Some sunlight reaches below 200m, but not enough to allow photosynthesis.
Only animals and bacteria live in these dim and dark waters, with the food chain based on detritus falling from surface waters.

The twilight zone
The twilight, or mesopelagic, zone, and extends from 200m to 1,000m down. Animals living here have various adaptations for living in the dimly lit waters. Some species have enormous eyes to find food. To avoid being eaten, many are transparent, including squid and crustaceans. Some fish have silvery reflective scales to help make them 'invisible'.

The dark depths
Almost no light penetrates below 1,000m. The water is cold, reaching 3oC, and contains very little oxygen. The pressure is enormous, up to 1,000 times that on the surface. These dark waters include the bathypelagic (1,000-4,000m), abyssopelagic (4,000m to the ocean floor) and hadopelagic (water in ocean trenches) zones.

Aliens in our midst
Despite the fact that 60% of our planet is covered by water over 1,600m deep, we know very little about pelagic and other deep-sea life. However, the few expeditions to these depths have revealed strange, almost alien-looking animals - such as fish with giant teeth and gaping jaws, long tentacle-like feelers, and even glowing patches.

The deep sea is much poorer in productivity than shallower regions. The fish tend to be much smaller than on the surface, with minimal bone structure and more jelly-like flesh. They are therefore slower and less agile than fish living near the surface. They also tend to grow much more slowly than surface fish. Some take many years to reach sexual maturity.
All teeth and mouth
Life in the deep-sea is scarce, so predators need large teeth and mouths to cope with whatever crosses their path. The fangtooth fish, for example, has the largest teeth of all marine animals in relation to body size, while gulpers can swallow prey at least as large as themselves.

Not completely dark
There is some light at these depths - from bioluminescence. An estimated 90% of deep-sea animals produce their own light to communicate, find food, and even to avoid capture.

For example, some shrimp squirt out a bioluminescent liquid to distract predators. There are fish with bioluminescent ��headlamps�� for finding food, while others, such as the deep-sea angler fish, use bioluminescent lures to catch prey. Some of these animals produce the light themselves, while others have recruited specialized bacteria to do the job.

Deep sea ecology: sea floor

Like land above the sea, the sea floor is a varied landscape of mountains, canyons, plains, and volcanoes.
Following on from the continental shelf, the continental slope continues gently down for thousands of kilometres towards the ocean floor - the vast, flat abyssal plain, reaching depths of 2,200-5,500m and covering over half the Earth��s surface.

Varied landscapes
It's not all flat, however. In some places the seabed drops down into trenches. The deepest is the Mariana Trench in the western North Pacific Ocean, whose deepest point is an incredible 10,911m below the surface.
The seabed also rises to form mountains. Running for over 56,000km through the middle of all oceans, the Mid-Oceanic Ridge is the world��s longest mountain range. It��s created by lava erupting from the Earth's crust - eruptions that account for 95% of all volcanic activity on our planet!
There are also a number of deep-sea geysers called hydrothermal vents and isolated underwater mountains called seamounts.

99% unknown
Scientists have only explored 1% of the sea floor. Indeed, we know less about the sea floor than the surface of the moon. Unsurprisingly, very little is known of its ecosystems.

Relying on manna from above
From what we do know, life is mostly scarce: the density of animals on the continental slope is much lower than on the continental shelf, and on the abyssal plain it is 1,000 times lower still. But the enormous area of this region makes the dominate form of life here, echinoderms (starfish, sea urchins, sea lilies, brittle stars, sea cucumbers, and sea daisies), amongst the most numerous animals on the planet.

With a few notable exceptions, the food chain depends on detritus - dead animals and faeces - falling from shallow waters. Rocky outcrops provide anchoring points for sea lilies, brittle stars, sponges, anemones, and cold-water corals, which filter this detritus from the water. Detritus reaching the muddy abyssal plain is eaten by sea urchins, starfish, sea slugs, crabs, shrimp, worms, bottom-feeding fish, and bacteria.
This life extends into the trenches: when a US Navy expedition made it to the bottom of the Mariana Trench in 1960 (the first and only manned venture this deep), fish and shrimp were observed.

Deep sea ecology: seamounts

Rising from the ocean floor to heights of 5,000m, seamounts are underwater mountains formed from volcanoes or sunken islands.
Some seamounts reach into surface, sunlit waters - or even break above the water to form islands - while others have their peaks a kilometre below the ocean surface.

Teeming with life
Unlike the continental slope and abyssal plain, deep-sea seamounts are densely inhabited. This is due to the currents of nutrient-rich water forced up their sides from the ocean floor. Cold-water corals, sponges, sea anemones, and sea fans form crowded communities on the rocky slopes, filtering these nutrients out of the water. Through this jungle move starfish, tiny lobsters, fish, and worms.
Like above-water islands, many seamounts have their own endemic species, which live nowhere else. A recent study of 24 seamounts near Tasmania, Australia, identified more than 850 species living on their slopes, most of which were unique to a particular seamount. Around one-third were new to science. Several of these are 'living fossils' - species from animal groups previously believed extinct since the time when dinosaurs roamed on dry land. With just a handful of the world��s estimated 31,000 seamounts having been explored, we can expect many more new species to be found.

Other species also visit seamounts. Normally scattered throughout the open ocean, many pelagic deep-sea fish species periodically gather in huge numbers at seamounts to feed and spawn. These include commercially valuable species such as orange roughy.

Deep sea: threats

A number of human activities threaten the deep sea:
Destructive fishing practices: Bottom trawling is currently the greatest threat to deep-sea biodiversity. First introduced in the 1980s, rockhopper trawls fitted with large rubber tires or rollers allow bottom trawling on virtually all of the ocean floor down to a depth of 2,000m.
These trawls - whose use is now widespread - crush everything in their path. In an experiment off Alaska, 55% of cold-water coral damaged by one pass of a trawl had not recovered a year later. Scars up to 4km long have been found in the reefs of the north-east Atlantic Ocean. And in heavily fished areas around coral seamounts off southern Australia, 90% of the surfaces where coral used to grow are now bare rock.

These and other deep-sea trawlers also kill a large amount of unwanted deep-sea life as bycatch.
Overfishing: Deep-sea species are generally extremely slow growing and do not reach sexual maturity for many years. Some commercial deep-sea fish also congregate in large numbers around seamounts to feed and spawn. And many deep-sea fisheries are located on the High Seas where there is often little or no regulation. These factors make deep-sea fish extremely vulnerable to overfishing. Newly fished populations of deep-sea species like Patagonian toothfish and orange roughy, for example, have been fished to commercial extinction in just a few years. At present most deep-water species are likely to be over-exploited - and as many as 40% of the world��s fishing grounds are now in waters deeper than 200m.

Oil, gas, and mineral exploration: At present, most oceanic reserves of oil, gas, and minerals are extracted from the continental shelf, under shallow coastal waters. However, with valuable reserves also located under the deep ocean floor, the oil and mining industries are expected to venture further afield, and eventually explore down to 3,000m. Such activity could have devastating effects on fragile, slow growing deep-sea communities.
